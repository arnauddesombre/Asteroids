# Asteroids
Game of Asteroids

This game was developed for Joe Warren, John Greiner, Stephen Wong and Scott Rixner's Coursera class "Interactive Programming in Python", and designed to work in CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org).

Olivier Pirson has developed a SimpleGUICS2Pygame module to translate CodeSkulptor to Pygame. Asteroids requires Python 2, SimpleGUICS2Pygame (pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame), and Pygame.

Asteroids.bat launches the game with the command:
python -O -OO asteroids.py --stop-timers

The available commands are indicated in the .bat file.
The image and sound asset directories can be created automatically by using:
python asteroids.py --save-downloaded-medias --print-load-medias 

If you like this game, I have developed an enhanced version for Android, available for free on Google Play:
