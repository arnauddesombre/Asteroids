# Asteroids
Game of Asteroids

This game was developed for Joe Warren, John Greiner, Stephen Wong, and Scott Rixner's Coursera class "Interactive Programming in Python" and designed to work in CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org).

Olivier Pirson has developed a SimpleGUICS2Pygame module to translate CodeSkulptor to Pygame. The game requires Python 2, SimpleGUICS2Pygame (pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame), and Pygame.
