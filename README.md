# Asteroids
Game of Asteroids

This game was developed for Joe Warren, John Greiner, Stephen Wong and Scott Rixner's Coursera class "Interactive Programming in Python", and designed to work in [CodeSkulptor ](www.codeskulptor.org).

Olivier Pirson has developed a SimpleGUICS2Pygame module to translate CodeSkulptor to Pygame. Asteroids requires Python 2, [Pygame](www.pygame.org/download.shtm), and SimpleGUICS2Pygame, which can be installed using the command:

    pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame

**Asteroids.bat** launches the game with the command:

    python -O -OO asteroids.py --stop-timers
The available commands are indicated in the .bat file.
The image and sound asset directories can be created automatically by using:

    python asteroids.py --save-downloaded-medias --print-load-medias

or simply downloaded from this repository.

If you like this game, I have developed an enhanced version for Android, available for free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=arnaud.desombre.asteroidwarfree):
